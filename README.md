ðŸ“Š HR Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)
This project is built using Power BI, where I transformed raw HR data collected from the internet into meaningful insights. The dashboard highlights key workforce metrics such as:

.Overall employee count & attrition trends

.Attrition rate by department, gender, and age group

.Average age and average years at the company

.Employee distribution across roles and experience levels

.Key patterns influencing attrition

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how HR data can be visualized effectively to support decision-making, improve retention strategies, and understand workforce demographics.
